Elastic Build is a plugin for cruisecontrol.rb that aims to provide transparent scaling of your builds over a collection of boxes. This works by allowing you to associate your builds with a pool of agents. The elastic build plugin will distribute your builds across the build agents in a round-robin fashion.

Design Principals:

* Transparent - you should not have to worry about the fact that your builds run on other boxes.
* Centralized - zero software needs installed on the agent machines (besides what you need to run your application)
* Simple - the only additional configuration needed are the pool files, which are just a simple list of server names

Installation:

* git clone this repository
* copy the contents of the repositories lib directory into ~/.cruise/builder_plugins/
* create the pools configuration directory in ~/.cruise/pools/
* create files for each of the pools you wish to use, example: ~/.cruise/pools/testpool
server-a.com
server-b.com
* set up ssh keys between the server running cc.rb and your agent boxes
* In your cruise build configuration, assign your builds to pools like so

project.elastic_build.pool = :testpool


Next Steps:

* script the installation
* integrate current agent into the build page/dashboard
* add some sort of utilization metrics for the agents
* script adding/removing agents with EC2
* make this a gem?
